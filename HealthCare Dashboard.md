Healthcare Data Modeling and Analysis for Better Insights Healthcare Data Analysis

This project leverages healthcare data to deliver actionable insights for improved patient care and resource management. By integrating diverse data sources such as patient records, lab results, and treatment histories, it employs advanced modeling techniques like regression and machine learning to classify diseases and predict outcomes. Additionally, interactive dashboards visualize key metrics, including readmission rates and costs, while predictive analytics help identify high-risk patients and forecast resource needs. The ultimate aim is to empower healthcare providers with data-driven insights to enhance care quality and operational efficiency.
